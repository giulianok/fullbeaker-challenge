# Full Beaker Challenge

The project uses HTML, SCSS and some jQuery.

To run the project: `npm i && npm start`

## What you're going to find

* I normally work with Components and I follow OOCSS ideas, meaning that I normally don't use selectors like by ID and element, I use classes, since it's more scalable and easy to maintain. Classes in camel case like Home, BoxWithShadow, Slider, SocialMedia, etc are basically like "Components".
* I used plain HTML. Sometimes, when I don't work with ReactJS and I do only html and css like in this case for example, I use Pug (https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) which helps me to break the html and multiple files. I didn't use it in this project since I didn't know if the reviewer is comfortable with that.
* ADA support should be Level A, maybe almost Level AA. I didn't implement any Aria attributes, but I did a good HTML structure, so ADA is supported.
* I only tested it on latest Chrome and Safari, and Chrome for Android.
* The site is responsive. It can be improve it, not sure what's the expectations on that since I only have Desktop design.
* I only used 2x images, I don't think that will impact on performance, since the images are pretty light. One think that I could implement was sprite images to reduce the amount of requests. Also, 3x images are missing.
* The final site looks very close to the design, but I didn't spend time on "Pixel Perfect"

Please let me know if you have any question or trouble running the project.
